# OwnCloud 9 Docker image with PHP 7

OwnCloud does not have a dependency on PHP 7, but some third-party apps
and their libraries do. There are some other PHP 7 images out there
but they come with a lot of additional "functionality" and this is an
effort to port the official image with as little change as possible.

Do appropriate due diligence on this image prior to using in production.
